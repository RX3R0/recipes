Ingredients:
 - a microwaveable coffee cup or bowl
 - bread (stale ok!)
 - 1 egg
 - 1-3 tablespoons sugar
 - 2 tablespoons of yogurt or milk
 - 1-2 tablespoons of butter / margarine
 - 2 tablespoons applesauce 
 - 1 tsp vanilla 
 - dash of cinnamin

Directions:
  1. Tear up your inedible bread.  Put the pieces into the cup and set aside. 
  2. Whisk together all remaining ingredients. If your butter is not
  soft enough yet, it's ok to melt it.  Pour the mixture on top of the
  bread. If needed, use a fork to help it along down into the crevices
  so it makes its way throughout the bread
  3. Pop in the microwave for about 2 minutes. When it's done, let it
  cool for as long as you can stand it. Letting it set for a few
  minutes allows the flavor and texture to set in.  Once cooled to
  your liking, dig in and enjoy!
